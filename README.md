# Welcome to kvm-unit-tests

See http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVM-unit-tests for a high-level
description of this project, as well as running tests and adding
tests HOWTOs.

# Building the tests

This directory contains sources for a kvm test suite.

To create the test images do:

    ./configure
    make

in this directory. Test images are created in ./<ARCH>/*.flat

## Standalone tests

The tests can be built as standalone
To create and use standalone tests do:

    ./configure
    make standalone
    (send tests/some-test somewhere)
    (go to somewhere)
    ./some-test

'make install' will install all tests in PREFIX/share/kvm-unit-tests/tests,
each as a standalone test.


# Running the tests

Then use the runner script to detect the correct invocation and
invoke the test:

    ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat
or:

    ./run_tests.sh

to run them all.

To select a specific qemu binary, specify the QEMU=<path>
environment variable:

    QEMU=/tmp/qemu/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat

## Directory structure

    .:				configure script, top-level Makefile, and run_tests.sh
    ./scripts:		helper scripts for building and running tests
    ./lib:			general architecture neutral services for the tests
    ./lib/<ARCH>:	architecture dependent services for the tests

See <ARCH>/README for architecture specific documentation.

## Style

Currently there is a mix of indentation styles so any changes to
existing files should be consistent with the existing style. For new
files:

  - C: please use standard linux-with-tabs
  - Shell: use TABs for indentation

## Patches

Patches are welcome at the KVM mailing list <kvm@vger.kernel.org>.

You can add the following to .git/config to do this automatically for you:

    [format]
        subjectprefix = kvm-unit-tests PATCH

Please run the kernel's ./scripts/checkpatch.pl on new patches
